# Farming Simulator (C++)
This is a project for csc122 at Harper College.
### You begin the game with a limited supply of seeds, and can get more seeds by growing crops
## Controls
- You can move around with WASD.
- You can view your inventory with "i"
- You can plant your current selected seed with "p"
- You can change your selected seed with "o"
- You can harvest the crop with "h" (if it's grown)
- You can view controls in game with "l"
- You can quit the game with "q"
- You (currently) end the day by with "e"
- You can water the current plot you're on with "t"
- You can go to the shop by with "m"
  - *you can buy seeds of plants you have, and new ones as the game progresses*
  - *also upgrades to the capacity of your watering can*
  - *and sell your crops for money to buy things*
- You can exit most sub menus by with "r"
- You can exit the game by pressing "q"

## Other things of Importance
Bunnies will show up on the perimeter of your farm!
- They will move *(mostly) randomly at the end of a day, and eat anything they move over.
- You can scare them off by standing in an adjacent spot, and make them run 4 spots in the opposite direction.
- You can't move through them, and they can't move through each-other.
Weeds will grow on your farmland, they look like -> *
- make sure to pull them (same button as harvest, "h")
You can only water a limited amount of times in a day! So use it wisely!
- *but only when you have enough water*
- *(it resets at the end of the day)*
A "Hard Mode" begins after 10 days have past.

Matured plants are always capital letters, any non-capital letter is not yet matured
